# GrubDash

This project used the ability to build APIs with complex validation, by doing the following:

- Run tests from the command line.
- Use common middleware packages.
- Receive requests through routes.
- Access relevant information through route parameters.
- Build an API following RESTful design principles.
- Write custom middleware functions.
